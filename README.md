## Instrucciones de construcción

We want to develop a simple game -Tyler- in React.js.
The game consists in a square matrix of square tiles that will be all of the same color except
for one.
To play, the user will need to click on that different colored tile to proceed to the next level.
The game is over when the user clicks on a wrong tile.
We don’t have a list of tasks, but instead, a set of business rules to develop this game:
  1. The layout consists only on the game matrix, a counter showing the current score
  (starting at zero) and a leaderboard showing the top 5 high scores.
  2. The leaderboard must be non-volatile, but there’s no need for an API.
  3. The starting level is always a two by two matrix.
  4. On each level, the order of the matrix is increased by one.
  5. The color for each level tiles must be randomly generated.
  6. The color of the different tile has to be the same as the other tiles, differing only in its
  lightness.
  7. When the user loses, he might be presented with an input to complete with his name
  to enter the top 5 leaderboard.

## Codebase rules:

  1. The app must be developed using React.js.
  2. There must be a readme file documenting installation and usage.
  3. You can use any boilerplates, frameworks, libraries and UI helpers you want, but they
  must be included in the readme file documenting its purpose and a brief explanation
  with the reasoning for your choice.
  4. Code must be pushed into any public repository of your choice, sharing the link to ---
